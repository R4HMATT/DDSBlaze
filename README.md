This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, first you'll want to run:

### `npm install` 

then to start the web app run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Note, this is in httpS, if there is a browser error trying to access it, (in chrome) click on advanced permissions and it should let you proceed to the site


Make sure to open the console to view information logged (you'll see access token printed there)

If you haven't already, give me your email for me to add you to the sharepoint website being used for home development

Sharepoint Site

### [https://rahmnik.sharepoint.com/sites/DDSBlazeWFH/](https://rahmnik.sharepoint.com/sites/DDSBlazeWFH/)

The task is to see if we can access sharepoint list data, if you figure it out, make sure to print some of the data in the console.log

The list we are using on the sharepoint site is called [DDSB Contacts Info](https://rahmnik.sharepoint.com/sites/DDSBlazeWFH/Lists/DDSB%20Contacts%20Info/AllItems.aspx)

### NOTE: We are using MSAL library for OAUTH2, see [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-core/README.md)
